# Dedofuscator
This is a deobfuscator for Ankama's Dofuscator that is used in the RawDataMessage*

It is still in a beta phase, which means it is not completed yet. as the weird functions that calculate some stuff are still there and it's still in progress.

USAGE:

- Decompile your RawDataMessage.swf using JPEX Decompiler, (IMPORTANT: Automatic deobfuscation should be ON ! otherwise this wont work.)
- Put your decompiled sources in the /Input folder, then run the program.


* = RawDataMessage is a Message in Dofus 2 that sends an swf file to be executed in the client to verify it's integrity and such, it is obfuscated and a little bit hard to read, but this fixes this issue.
